# MasterToMain

MasterToMain is a script to help you change from master to main

## Background

https://www.kapwing.com/blog/how-to-rename-your-master-branch-to-main-in-git/ does a great job of discussing the background. Their approach is different from ours, as they assume you don't have any tooling internal to the repo (github actions, travis, etc) which references master.
